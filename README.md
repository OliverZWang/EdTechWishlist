# Ed Tech Wishlist

*This project is dedicated to the memory of Professor Nathan Hull and Professor Suzanne McIntosh. It was their faith in me that inspired me to pursue Computer Science and this senior project, yet they are unable to see my graduation. This is for them.*

[EdTech Wishlist](https://edtech-wishlist.herokuapp.com/) is a platform where educators and developers come together to brainstorm and build EdTech software to facilitate teaching and learning.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, [Professor Craig Kapp](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kapp/), who gave me the opportunity to do build this meaningful project under his tutelage. He was kind enough to offer his time and expertise desipte his busy schedule this semester, which I appreciate deeply. 

One of my best friends, [Alan Luo](https://iltc.io/), had multiple meetings with me to discuss the project, helped me troubleshoot, and shared his expertise, which turned out to be tremendously helpful. 

The Django tutorials by [Corey Schafer](http://coreyms.com/) and [CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingEntrepreneurs/featured) were not only great resources to learn Django, but were also great inspirations for the implementation and deployment of the project.

I would also like to thank Joseph Kassick, a Reading Recovery Teacher Leader from Flemington Raritan School District, for providing a brilliant EdTech idea document, which we used as a Example Post on our website.
