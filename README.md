## Acknowledgement

I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, [Professor Craig Kapp](https://cims.nyu.edu/~kapp/), who gave me the opportunity to do build this meaningful project under tutelage. He was kind enough to offer his time and expertise desipte his busy schedule this semester, which I appreciate deeply. 

One of my best friends, [Alan Luo](https://iltc.io/), had multiple meetings with me to discuss the project and helped me troubleshoot, which turned out to be tremendously helpful. 

The Django tutorials by [Corey Schafer](http://coreyms.com/) and [CodingEntrepreneurs](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodingEntrepreneurs/featured) were not only great resources to learn Django, but were also great inspirations for the implementation and deployment for the project.

I would also like to thank Joseph Kassick, a Reading Recovery Teacher Leader from Flemington Raritan School District, for providing a brilliant EdTech idea document, which we used as a Example Post on our website.
